This is a simple web application that helps you classify a triangle based on the lengths of its sides entered in centimeters (cm). 

**What it does:**

* Prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle.
* Analyzes the side lengths to determine the triangle type (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, or Invalid).
* Displays the triangle type on the webpage.
